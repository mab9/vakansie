A vacation planer that serves as my personal tech toolkit 

Vakansie is a web app that contains many concepts and examples from a technical point of view. 
To that, concepts shall be applicable and testable in a fast way to earn knowledge. One of my favorite part. 
This project shall help me to grow and specialize my skills.

## Installing vakansie

To install vakansie, follow these steps:

``` 
git clone https://github.com/mab9/vakansie.git
open ./vakansie-frontend/index.html in your favorite browser
```

**Only the frontend part of the web app is available at the moment.** 

## JS frontend framework

Some planned components:

- Router
- JWT 
- Menu rights, view, ctrl
- Rest client / http and mocks
- test framework
- Architectural descriptions

**Sooner or later I will extract the frontend framework into a dedicated repository**
