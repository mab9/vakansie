A vacation planer that serves as my personal tech toolkit 

Vakansie is a web app that contains many concepts and examples from a technical point of view. 
To that, concepts shall be applicable and testable in a fast way to earn knowledge. One of my favorite part. 
This project shall help me to grow and specialize my skills.

## Installing vakansie

To install vakansie, follow these steps:

``` 
git clone https://github.com/mab9/vakansie.git
open ./vakansie-frontend/index.html in your favorite browser
```

**Only the frontend part of the web app is available at the moment.** 

## JS frontend framework

Some planned components:

- Router
- JWT 
- Menu rights, view, ctrl
- Rest client / http and mocks
- test framework
- Architectural descriptions

**Sooner or later I will extract the frontend framework into a dedicated repository**

## My next ideas

There will be a lot of tech stuff within this repo. To find a good structural overview about all those ideas is crucial.

### Frontend 
- provide style guide 
- provide new approval features
- provide 1 final styled and responsive template
- extract parts to build a frontend js framework
- provide templates to build responsive websites
- build multiple frontends with different js frameworks like angular, react, vue and others
- compare different frontend frameworks

### Backend

- Build KISS backend with spring boot
- Build backend from scratch without spring
- Make use of spring security
- Make different modules with demos for prepared and non prepared sql statements
- Use and explain different patterns (Strategy, State, Decorator, Factory and more)


### Database

- Use different db technologies, NoSql, GraphQl and more
- Use postgres and try to tweak the db to the best, fine tuning

### Testing

- Use Apache JMeter to make performance tests
- Test Canary release
- Use Mockito and make some examples how to use it

### Installation and CI/CD

- Use stack Kubernetes, Helm, docker 
- Use multiple environments
